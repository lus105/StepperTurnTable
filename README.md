# Content
This repository contains 2 samples:  
1. **StepperControl** - contain code for Arduino NANO to control TMC2208 circuit for NEMA17. **This sample contains all the output controls and might not work without all the parts connected to the setup**.
2. **SendRespond** - simplified sample for generic Arduino boards to send and receive commands over Serial. **It does not require any components connected to the board**.
